              We aim to launch an energy supply business through AEHL US, formerly
              known as Million Star US Inc. AEHL US has taken preliminary steps in
              developing this business including engaging a broker to source
              natural gas from natural gas provider in Texas and the procurement
              of electricity generators.
            </p>
            <p className="py-1">
              AEHL US plans to supply power to a data center in Midland, Texas.
              This energy supply business began operation in the third quarter of
              2024. Further, AEHL US also plans to generate revenue by securing
              hosting sites for cryptocurrency mining operators as it leverages
              anticipated cost-effective electricity costs.
