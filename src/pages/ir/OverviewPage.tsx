          Antelope Enterprise Holding Limited (“Antelope Enterprise”) primarily

          <h2>Energy Supply Business - AEHL US</h2>
          <p>
            We aim to launch an energy supply business through AEHL US, formerly
            known as Million Star US Inc. AEHL US has taken preliminary steps in
            developing this business including engaging a broker to source
            natural gas from natural gas provider in Texas and the procurement
            of electricity generators.
          </p>
          <p>
            AEHL US plans to supply power to a data center in Midland, Texas.
            This energy supply business began operation in the third quarter of
            2024. Further, AEHL US also plans to generate revenue by securing
            hosting sites for cryptocurrency mining operators as it leverages
            anticipated cost-effective electricity costs.

            ecommerce. We believe that livestreaming ecommerce is an important
            growth engine for consumer good brands as it leverages the content
            of livestreaming to boost sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our customers usually include consumer goods brands, merchants, and
            small-scale ecommerce platforms. We grow and train our hosts and
            influencers to provide engaging content to livestream who then
            promote our customers’ products on various livestreaming platforms.
